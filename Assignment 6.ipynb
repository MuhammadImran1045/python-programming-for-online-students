    "Answer: OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "object-oriented programming is a programming language paradigm. In an object-oriented program, the code can be structured as reusable components, some of which may share properties or behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming can improve the developer's ability to quickly prototype software, extend existing functionality, refactor the code, and maintain it as it's developed."

    "\n",
    "Answer: Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). OOP is faster and easier to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2). OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3). OOP helps to keep the code DRY \"Don't Repeat Yourself\", and makes the code      easier to maintain, modify and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4). OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code      and shorter development time. "

    "# 2. Object\n",
    "# 3. Attribute\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "# (1). Class: \n",
    "A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class . An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (2). Object:\n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language. Unlike procedure oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stress on objects. Object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. And, class is a blueprint for the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (3). Attribute:\n",
    "An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object. ... A class attribute is a Python variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular object. It is shared between all the objects of this class and it is defined outside the constructor function, __init__(self,...) , of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (4). Behavior:\n",
    "Behavioral Programming (BP) is an approach and technique for software development, which enables incremental development in a natural way. A behavioral application consists of threads of behavior each of which represents an independent scenario that the system should and shouldn't follow."
